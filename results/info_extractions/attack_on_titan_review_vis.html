<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Genuinely the greatest show I have ever seen</span> 

*NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW* 

I can&#x27;t put into words the emotions I felt when watching this show over the course of two 
months. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">It honestly completely took over my entire life and personality, and it was all I 
could think about</span>... 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">There&#x27;s never been a show with as many plot twists as this, as deep of emotional 
connections to the characters through the screen as this, or written greatness as this.</span> 

But know that every single detail should not go unnoticed. Every single word that the 
characters say. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">EVERYTHING is foreshadowing, and the circular storytelling is 
revolutionary like no other.</span> 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Hands down, this is the most incredible show with incredible characters, storytelling, 
and attention to detail.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this story.</span>

AOT: <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The Greatest Anime I&#x27;ve Ever Seen</span> 

Attack On Titan is oƯicially over. And <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">nothing will ever be the same.</span> 

When I ﬁnished Breaking Bad back in 2019 prior to ever watching anime, if someone told 
me <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an anime would be on the same playing ﬁeld as Breaking Bad and even exceed it at 
times</span>, I would&#x27;ve told them they were crazy. But in reality, I was the crazy one. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">This story 
took me places mentally and emotionally I didn&#x27;t think I could go.</span> 

In this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are 
objectively wrong, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there&#x27;s never a moment where you can deﬁnitively say that 
someone&#x27;s the good guy or bad guy.</span> Once you see the full picture of the show, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it&#x27;s 
indescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much 
everyone&#x27;s in this dark abyss of a gray area that has no objective answer to whom is in 
the right or wrong.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">And that&#x27;s the beauty of AOT.</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Attack On Titan is not meant to be joyous. It&#x27;s a tragedy.</span> It&#x27;s an unfair world where 
everyone at some point is given a dirty hand whether they deserve it or not, and the 
characters have to try and live with that reality and keep moving forward. Now that 
doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t moments where you as a viewer can feel joyous for your 
perspective favorite character/side because there likely will be, but when you&#x27;re no 
longer told the story through this small microscope, you won&#x27;t be able to see the show 
the same. 

And that&#x27;s where <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the absurd genius of the creator Hajime Isayama</span> comes into play. As 
much as I love the Vince Gilligan&#x27;s of the world, David Chase, Peter Gould, Jesse 
Armstrong, David Simon and honestly any writer of any piece of ﬁction... <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">no one comes 
close to the creativity that this man has</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Isayama is able to create this large world in 
these small walls surrounded by humanoid creatures that live to destroy and ruin the 
human race</span>. But as you continue to watch the show, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re peeling an endless 
onion that doesn&#x27;t stop, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">constantly makes your eyes water and tear up due to the 
brutality and the absurdity that this universe subjects you to</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">It will boggle your mind 
then tear you to shreds in ways that I&#x27;ve never seen before</span>. 

<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The plot twists are second to none</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The heartbreak will shatter you to pieces</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The 
betrayals will leave you speechless</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The world building will make everything before 
seem small</span>. And <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the clashes of diƯerent ideals will leave you wondering how you could 
even pick a side</span>. I could go on all day but to put it simply, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the unique story in itself is 
what brings this all together</span>. And that&#x27;s not even mentioning things like <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the voice acting, 
music, animation, esc. Which are all top tier</span>. 

This isn&#x27;t an anime. This isn&#x27;t a TV show. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">This is a ﬁctional masterpiece</span>. And I&#x27;m honored 
and blessed to say that I got to live to see the day where I&#x27;d witness the end of it. Thank 
you, Hajime Isayama. And see you later, AOT. 


10/10 

Masterpiece. I&#x27;ve never witnessed <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">this level of care for every detail</span>. 

The moment you watch this <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">audiovisual masterpiece</span> you will immediately appreciate 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the level of thought and detail that went into this</span>. From the initial scene that shows you 
the main and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">unique weapons</span> to some of the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="31" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">frames that could literally be used as your</span>
&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;&quot;&quot;
desktop background or be hanged in your room as paintings. From episode to episode 
you&#x27;ll think that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="32" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you won&#x27;t be surprised anymore and you&#x27;ll be wrong again and again</span>, 
every time I thought an episode or season couldn&#x27;t be better I was proven wrong. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="33" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">You 
will get goos bumps from dialog alone</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="34" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you will lose your mind in the epic ﬁght 
scenes</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="35" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The characters and their development, the story covered in mystery that unveils 
beautifully, a dialog carefully written that shows the characters personalities and 
wisdom., sound design, music, illumination...</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="36" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">you&#x27;ll feel like you are there</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="37" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The voicing of 
the characters is excellent</span>... <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="38" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there is nothing below excellent in this</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="39" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">An absolute 
masterpiece and a bar of quality for any audio visual product to come</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="40" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Be prepared to 
care only about Attack on Titan and nothing else, because nothing else will make you 
feel this way</span>.
