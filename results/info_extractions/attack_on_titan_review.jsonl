have ever seen \n \n*NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW* \n \nI can't put into words the emotions I felt when watching this show over the course of two \nmonths. It honestly completely took over my entire life and personality, and it was all I \ncould think about... \n \nThere's never been a show with as many plot twists as this, as deep of emotional \nconnections to the characters through the screen as this, or written greatness as this. \n \nBut know that every single detail should not go unnoticed. Every single word that the \ncharacters say. EVERYTHING is foreshadowing, and the circular storytelling is \nrevolutionary like no other. \n \nHands down, this is the most incredible show with incredible characters, storytelling, \nand attention to detail. Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this story. \n \n \n10/10 \nAOT: The Greatest Anime I've Ever Seen \n \nAttack On Titan is oƯicially over. And nothing will ever be the same. \n \nWhen I ﬁnished Breaking Bad back in 2019 prior to ever watching anime, if someone told \nme an anime would be on the same playing ﬁeld as Breaking Bad and even exceed it at \ntimes, I would've told them they were crazy. But in reality, I was the crazy one. This story \ntook me places mentally and emotionally I didn't think I could go. \n \nIn this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are \nobjectively wrong, there's never a moment where you can deﬁnitively say that \nsomeone's the good guy or bad guy. Once you see the full picture of the show, it's \nindescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much \neveryone's in this dark abyss of a gray area that has no objective answer to whom is in \nthe right or wrong. And that's the beauty of AOT.\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nAttack On Titan is not meant to be joyous. It's a tragedy. It's an unfair world where \neveryone at some point is given a dirty hand whether they deserve it or not, and the \ncharacters have to try and live with that reality and keep moving forward. Now that \ndoesn't mean that there aren't moments where you as a viewer can feel joyous for your \nperspective favorite character/side because there likely will be, but when you're no \nlonger told the story through this small microscope, you won't be able to see the show \nthe same. \n \nAnd that's where the absurd genius of the creator Hajime Isayama comes into play. As \nmuch as I love the Vince Gilligan's of the world, David Chase, Peter Gould, Jesse \nArmstrong, David Simon and honestly any writer of any piece of ﬁction... no one comes \nclose to the creativity that this man has. Isayama is able to create this large world in \nthese small walls surrounded by humanoid creatures that live to destroy and ruin the \nhuman race. But as you continue to watch the show, it's like you're peeling an endless \nonion that doesn't stop, and constantly makes your eyes water and tear up due to the \nbrutality and the absurdity that this universe subjects you to. It will boggle your mind \nthen tear you to shreds in ways that I've never seen before. \n \nThe plot twists are second to none. The heartbreak will shatter you to pieces. The \nbetrayals will leave you speechless. The world building will make everything before \nseem small. And the clashes of diƯerent ideals will leave you wondering how you could \neven pick a side. I could go on all day but to put it simply, the unique story in itself is \nwhat brings this all together. And that's not even mentioning things like the voice acting, \nmusic, animation, esc. Which are all top tier. \n \nThis isn't an anime. This isn't a TV show. This is a ﬁctional masterpiece. And I'm honored \nand blessed to say that I got to live to see the day where I'd witness the end of it. Thank \nyou, Hajime Isayama. And see you later, AOT. \n \n \n10/10 \n \nMasterpiece. I've never witnessed this level of care for every detail. \n \nThe moment you watch this audiovisual masterpiece you will immediately appreciate \nthe level of thought and detail that went into this. From the initial scene that shows you \nthe main and unique weapons to some of the frames that could literally be used as your\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\ndesktop background or be hanged in your room as paintings. From episode to episode \nyou'll think that you won't be surprised anymore and you'll be wrong again and again, \nevery time I thought an episode or season couldn't be better I was proven wrong. You \nwill get goos bumps from dialog alone and you will lose your mind in the epic ﬁght \nscenes The characters and their development, the story covered in mystery that unveils \nbeautifully, a dialog carefully written that shows the characters personalities and \nwisdom., sound design, music, illumination... you'll feel like you are there. The voicing of \nthe characters is excellent... there is nothing below excellent in this. An absolute \nmasterpiece and a bar of quality for any audio visual product to come. Be prepared to \ncare only about Attack on Titan and nothing else, because nothing else will make you \nfeel this way.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_061dcb63"}
